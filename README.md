## project description
The Event Management Web App is a comprehensive platform designed to simplify the process of organizing, managing, and attending events. It enables event organizers to create, promote, and oversee events while providing attendees with a seamless experience for registration, ticketing, and participation. The platform incorporates automated reminders, analytics, and social sharing features to enhance event engagement and effectiveness.
